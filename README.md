Quick Note:
> **I started learning my first programming language at december 20, 2023 so the program may have some hidden bugs but bear with me. Also besides the program being related to AI, i didnt use AI to code it (more reason to have bugs but bear with me).**

Motivation Behind the Project
> **Hmm, i thought about this project because my main goal in learning to code is to work with AI, so in this final project i thought
it would be a great oportunity for learning about some key features of ai nowadays which is LLMs , TTS, STT(The bot dont have STT yet) and etc.
The name of the project was based on a Character which name is Projekt Red from a mobile game.
And thats it for this Readme, have fun!! *Also you can customize the bot persona at ollama.py file(dont work with textgen)**
